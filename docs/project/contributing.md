# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the QuoinAPI project! This
guide will help you set up your development environment and understand the
project structure.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control
- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) - Command runner
- [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) (recommended) or
  [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## ⚡️ Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/balakmran/quoin-api.git
cd quoin-api

# 2. Configure Environment
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Setup Project
just setup

# 4. Start DB, apply migrations, and run the server
just dev
```

## 📸 Application Home Page

After running the server, you can visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the application's home page:

![QuoinAPI Home Page](../assets/images/quoin-api-homepage.png)

This confirms the application is running correctly. The page includes:

- **Project Status**: Real-time health indicators for the application and its
  dependencies.
- **Quick Links**: Direct access to API documentation and other resources.

## 🤝 Contribution Workflow

### Fixing Bugs

1.  **Check Issues**: Look for existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2.  **Create Issue**: If not found, create a new issue describing the bug with
    reproduction steps.
3.  **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b fix/issue-number-short-description`
4.  **Reproduce**: Write a test case in `tests/` that reproduces the bug (it
    should fail).
5.  **Fix**: Implement the fix until the test passes.
6.  **Verify**: Run `just check` to ensure no regressions.
7.  **Submit PR**: Open a Pull Request referencing the issue.

### Adding Features

1.  **Propose**: Open a discussion or issue to propose the feature.
2.  **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`
3.  **Document**: Update `docs/` if the feature involves user-facing changes.
4.  **Implement**: Write tests and code. Follow TDD where possible.
5.  **Verify**: Run `just check`.
6.  **Submit PR**: Open a Pull Request.

### Coding Standards

We enforce strict coding standards to maintain a high-quality codebase.

- **AI Agents**: Please refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed
  architectural and stylistic rules.
- **Style**: We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for formatting and
  linting.
- **Types**: 100% type coverage is required.

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

This project maintains high code quality standards using:

- **Ruff**: For extremely fast linting and formatting.
- **ty**: For static type checking.
- **Pytest**: For testing.

Run all checks with a single command:

```bash
just check
```
